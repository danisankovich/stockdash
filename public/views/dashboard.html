  <!-- Dashboard: As a user I can see all of the stocks that I have saved
  Of the stocks that I have saved I see two categories, based on
  what I specified: "owned" and "tracked."
  Owned: I have purchased shares in this company. I can see the price that I bought them at,
  I can see the current price, the amount of shares I own, as well as a graph of prices over the last year. I also see
  the value at which I wish to sell, which, if the price reaches, I will get a notification, and
  the stock will be highlighted and labelled: "Target Reached"
  Tracked: I have not purchased shares, but I wish to keep track of a company. I see all of the same information as in the owned category,
  but instead of number of shares and price at purchase, I see price at addition. When this reaches a target point, it will be highlighted a different
  color and labelled: "Tracked: Target reached"


  Target prices: when a stock is added, one of the parameters is "Target": this will either be a flat number, or a percentage (not sure yet).
  If the price of the stock reaches that target, the user will get a notification via email that the stock has reached such a point, and on
  the dashboard the stock will move to a specific subcategory, depending on whether the user wishes to now purchase or sell.

  Every day (if they choose) the user will get a notification via email about articles concerning companies that they are tracking/have shares in.
  How this will be controlled TBD. For the time being, they will simply receive an email that contains one article for each company on their dashboard.

  Users will also be able to log in with other oauth procedures, and their oauths can be linked so that they do not have to sign in with the same
  strategy every time.

  The news section will have relevant headlines for general market information and for learning about the market, but users can search for anything
  specific that they like.
